              <p>
                In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection.
              </p>
              <p>
                These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.
              </p>
              <p>
                TEDx's mission is to foster learning, inspiration and wonder—and provoke conversations that matter in our local community.
